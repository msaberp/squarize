# squarize
This simple python code makes your image squarish! (with sharp edges)

input -> a binary image

squarize -> make the white space more squarish

inv_squarize -> make the black space more squarish

I also added opening and closing from morphological operations, to make the output image
more refined.

## requirements
1. opencv
2. numpy
